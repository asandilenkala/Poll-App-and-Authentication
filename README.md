Poll Application with User Authentication

This project extends the basic functionality of a poll application by adding user authentication features. Users must register and log in before they can participate in voting.
Features

    User Registration:
        A new user registration page allows users to sign up with a username, password, and first name.
    User Login:
        A login page where registered users can log in using their credentials.
    Voting Restriction:
        Users must be logged in to vote in polls. This ensures that only authenticated users can participate.
